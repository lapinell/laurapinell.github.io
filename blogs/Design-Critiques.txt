Setting My Design Critique Properties & Values

Can you tell I've been neck-deep in javascript? 

So to increase my awareness of the worlds web design, branding and uix, I came up with idea of doing a weekly critique based on Awwwards winners.

Clearly they won for a reason and so I want to give judging a go, then compare their "notes" with mine.

But first I have to define what my design values (and properties) are.

Persona: Can I pinpoint the persona of their target audience? If I can't then 0, if it's really easy to come up with then 10. This is also what the other properties will be based off of.

Usability: this is huge for me. Websites lose users so fast because the usability gives such a negative experience. How hard is it to search for what I'm looking for?

Aesthetics: How pleasant to the eye is this website to the persona?

Innovative Design: How innovative is the front-end design - visually speaking?

Cleanly Code: How clean is the final code and are their any errors in the console?
